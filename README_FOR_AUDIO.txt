   - This plays while counting down (when toggle is clicked).
   - Recommendation: Soft, romantic instrumental.

2. Birthday Message/Song
   - Name: voice_note.mp3
   - This plays AUTOMATICALLY when the timer hits 00:00.
   - It will stop the background music.

Setup:
1. Rename your files exactly as above.
2. Place them in: C:\Users\harsh\Downloads\Tissu Bday\
